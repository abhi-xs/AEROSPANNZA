Tools and Software Used
The 3D model of the runway and taxiway management system was created using Blender, an open-source 3D modeling software. Blender was chosen for its robust capabilities in rendering realistic models and its compatibility with various design workflows. The version of Blender used for this project was [insert version number], and additional plugins were integrated for lighting and material textures.

Model Development Process
The 3D model was meticulously crafted to represent realistic airport infrastructure, including the runway, taxiway, control tower, radar dome, and ground vehicles. Several challenges were encountered during the design phase, particularly in accurately representing sensor placements and ensuring the realism of the airport components.

To ensure an authentic depiction of sensor placements, we followed guidelines from technical aviation sources. This involved aligning sensor positions for optimal coverage and incorporating real-world data to simulate conditions such as lighting and weather impact on radar and LiDAR sensor performance.
